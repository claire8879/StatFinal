# <u>**Statistical Learning Final Project**</u>

## **Part 1: Introduction**

For this project, I will be looking at Universal Bank dataset (The github containing the datset can be found [here](https://github.com/reisanar/datasets/blob/master/UniversalBank.csv)).

1. What is my research question?
  + Using the dataset, I want to understand if customers' attributes can help to predicate what kind of service (credit card, loan, etc.) they are most likely to get from the bank. These predictions can then be used in things such as advertising to ensure they get ads for the service they are most likely to use.
  
<br>

2. Why do I care? Should you care?
  + I care because a large part of data science (my major) is using data to better understand patterns and make predictions off of those patterns. In this case, figuring out what type of services a customer would want could be an integral part of my future employment. 
  + You should care because this can help you to better undertsand machine learning and give a small, simplified glimpse into how companies target ads to you and make important business decisions.

## **Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
```{r warning=FALSE}
#Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
library(randomForest)
library(caret)
```


```{r}
#Load in the data
bankdf <- read.csv('UniversalBank.txt')
```


The columns in the dataset can be further explained by the Data Dictionary from the Github:
![Data Dictionary from the Github](C:\Users\Claire R\Downloads\bankdict.JPG)
```{r}
#Summary Stats
summary(bankdf)
```

```{r fig.height=7, fig.width=15}
#Correlation between features and target columns 

corrs <- cor(bankdf[, c("ID", "Age", "Experience", "Income", "ZIP.Code", "Family", "CCAvg", "Education", "Mortgage")], bankdf[, c("Personal.Loan", "Securities.Account", "CD.Account", "Online", "CreditCard")])

#Turn into dataframe
cordf <- melt(corrs)

#change column names 
colnames(cordf) <- c("Feature", "Target", "Correlation")

# Create a multiple bar graph using ggplot2
ggplot(cordf, aes(x = Feature, y = Correlation, fill = Target)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Correlation between Features and Targets (Targets Seperated)", y = "Correlation coefficient")
```
From this, we can see which features are going to be useful in predicting our target variables and don't correlate much such as ID, Age, Experience, and ZIP.Code. We can also see that some of the target variables don't correlate very heavily with any of the features and, therefore, may be hard to predict. However, if we include the targets in the correlation, it may help by giving more data to work with instead of keeping them all separate

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=20}
#Correlation between features and target columns 

corrs <- cor(bankdf[, c("ID", "Age", "Experience", "Income", "ZIP.Code", "Family", "CCAvg", "Education", "Mortgage", "Personal.Loan", "Securities.Account", "CD.Account", "Online", "CreditCard")], bankdf[, c("Personal.Loan", "Securities.Account", "CD.Account", "Online", "CreditCard")])

#Turn into dataframe
cordf <- melt(corrs)

#change column names 
colnames(cordf) <- c("Feature", "Target", "Correlation")

#Drop rows containing 1 (correlation to self)
cordf <- subset(cordf, Correlation != 1)

# Create a multiple bar graph using ggplot2
ggplot(cordf, aes(x = Feature, y = Correlation, fill = Target)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Correlation between Features and Targets (Targets not Seperated)", y = "Correlation coefficient")
```

```{r}
#removing low correlation features

```


## **Part 3: Methods**

```{r}
#Splitting into training and test data

# Vector of target variable names
targets <- c("Personal.Loan", "Securities.Account", "CD.Account", "Online", "CreditCard")

# Empty list to store confusion matrices
confusionMatrixList <- list()

# Loop over target variables
for (i in seq_along(targets)) {
  
  # Split the data into training and test data
  trainIndex <- createDataPartition(bankdf[, targets[i]], p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
  trainData <- bankdf[trainIndex, ]
  testData <- bankdf[-trainIndex, ]
  
  # Train the random forest model
  model <- randomForest(trainData[, !names(trainData) %in% targets], trainData[, targets[i]])
  
  # Make predictions using the test data
  predictions <- predict(model, testData)
  
  # Check the model's performance
  confusionMatrix <- confusionMatrix(predictions, testData[, targets[i]])
  print(confusionMatrix)
  
  # Add the confusion matrix to the list
  confusionMatrixList[[i]] <- confusionMatrix$table
}

# Combine the confusion matrices into a single table
allconfusionMatrix <- do.call(rbind, confusionMatrixList)

# Print the combined confusion matrix
print(allconfusionMatrix)
```








(b) Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Compute relevant descriptive statistics, including summary statistics and visualization of the data.

Also address what the exploratory data analysis suggests about your research question.

(c) Part 3: Methods

Check any conditions needed to support your analysis. Review the structure of your data, and test the effectiveness of the statistical learning methods you chose for your work.

Describe the motivation behind your analysis, and explain your findings.

Be sure to interpret your results in the context of the problem.

(d) Part 4: Conclusions

Summarize your findings.

Include a discussion of what you have learned about your initial research question and the data you used. You may also want to note limitations in your study and include ideas for possible future research.
